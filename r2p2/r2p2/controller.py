""" Module defining what a controller is from a data structure POV.

Aside from defining what the Controller class requires as an abstract class,
this module provides two example controllers, as well as an abstract factory
in order to ease instancing controllers using configuration files. Usage of
this abstract factory is mandatory. In order to use it, just create a factory
method that takes a dictionary as input and returns a subclass of Controller
as output, then register the result using register_controller_factory.
Modification of this module is heavily discouraged.
